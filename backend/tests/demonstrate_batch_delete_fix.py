"""
Integration test demonstrating the fix for batch regex operations.

This script simulates the batch delete operation that was failing before the fix.
It creates a temporary configuration with regex patterns, then uses the RegexChannelMatcher
to delete patterns, showing that the delete_channel_pattern method now exists and works.
